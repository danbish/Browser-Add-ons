Browser-Add-ons
===============

A collection of browser add-ons that have been created, modified or copied for future use.

Feel free to utilize them within the boundaries of the license for the respective add-on.

If you would like to contribute to this repository you may make a pull request.  Unfortunately we
cannot allow everything because some "ambitious" developers do things like embed advertising and
user tracking into their add-ons, and we do not support that behavior.
