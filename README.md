Browser-Add-ons
===============

A collection of browser add-ons that have been created, modified or copied for future use.

Feel free to utilize them within the boundaries of the license for the respective add-on.

Each add-on will ultimately have its own branch.  We will try to keep the master branch updated as
often as possible.

If you would like to contribute to this repository you may make a pull request.  Unfortunately we
cannot allow everything because some "ambitious" developers do things like embed advertising and
user tracking into their add-ons, and we do not support that behavior.
