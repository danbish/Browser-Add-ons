Quail-JS-Browser-Add-ons
===========================

Browser add-ons that have been created with Quail JS at their core.

Feel free to utilize the add-ons within the boundaries of the license.

If you would like to contribute to this repository you may make a pull request.  Unfortunately we
cannot allow everything because some "ambitious" developers do things like embed advertising and
user tracking into their add-ons, and we do not support that behavior.
